# xlunch
Graphical app launcher for X, using pure Xlib and Imlib2. It allows you to run a program by clicking its icon. Alternatively
you can just type any command using your keyboard. UTF8 is supported.
The Run commandline also works as a filter for the icons, as long as the title or command matches, icon is visible.

**Available Modes**

- Kiosk mode - in this mode, the Run comand is disabled, thus user cannot
    type any command. He can only select icons to run. Input focus is not
    affected by this mode
- Fork mode - in this mode, the started commands are run as new process
    and the launcher keeps running. Input focus is not affected by this mode
- Desktop mode - in this mode, the launcher sends itself to lowest position,
    so all other windows are above it. This emulates desktop with icons.
    Input focus is affected in the way that the launcher never gets focus.

It is possible to combine all modes together.

    title;icon_path;cmd
    title;icon_path;cmd
    title;icon_path;cmd
    title;icon_path;cmd


**Compile:**

    gcc xlunch.c -o xlunch -lImlib2 -lX11 -lXcursor


Config file can be generated by ./genconf > /etc/xlunch/icons.conf

Best practice is when you have a keyboard shortcut to start xlunch, such as Alt+F2
Or have a button in taskbar to run it.

To start xlunch on i3wm for example, add this line to ~/.i3/config:

    bindsym $mod+F2 exec /usr/bin/xlunch
