Graphical app launcher for X with little dependencies

Current version has the following limitations:
- background wallpaper is used from X's root window. If you do not have any image set, it fails to run
- font is hardcoded to DejaVuSans
- all parameters (margin, padding, positions) are hardcoded. My plan is to let user specify them on command line
